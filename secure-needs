### Insecure cloud, container or orchestration configuration.

Examples:

- Publicly open s3 bucket
- Container runs as root
- Container shares resources with the host (network interface, etc.)
- Insecure Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) configuration

### Injection flaws (app layer, cloud events, cloud services).

Examples:

- SQL injection
- XXE
- NoSQL injection
- OS command injection
- Serverless event data injection

### Improper authentication & authorization.

Examples:

- Unauthenticated API access on a microservice
- Over-permissive cloud IAM role
- Lack of orchestrator node trust rules (e.g. unauthorized hosts joining the cluster)
- Unauthenticated orchestrator console access
- Unauthrized or overly-permissive orchestrator access

### CI/CD pipeline & software supply chain flaws.

Examples:

- Insufficient authentication on CI/CD pipeline systems
- Use of untrusted images
- Use of stale images
- Insecure communication channels to registries
- Overly-permissive registry access
- Using a single environment to run CI/CD tasks for projects requiring different levels of security

### Insecure secrets storage.

Examples:

- Orchestrator secrets stored unencrypted
- API keys or passwords stored unencrypted inside containers
- Hardcoded application secrets
- Poorly encrypted secrets (e.g. use of obsolete encryption methods, use of encoding instead of encryption, etc.)
- Mounting of storage containing sensitive information
...

CNAS-6: Over-permissive or insecure network policies.
Examples:
- Over-permissive pod to pod communication allowed
- Internal microservices exposed to the public Internet
- No network segmentation defined
- End-to-end communications not encrypted
- Network traffic to unknown or potentially malicious domains not monitored and blocked

### Using components with known vulnerabilities.

Examples:

- Vulnerable 3rd party open source packages
- Vulnerable versions of application components
- Use of known vulnerable container images

### Improper assets management.

Examples:

- Undocumented microservices & APIs
- Obsolete & unmanaged cloud resources

### Inadequate 'compute' resource quota limits.

Examples:

- Resource-unbound containers
- Over-permissive request quota set on APIs

### Ineffective logging & monitoring (e.g. runtime activity).

Examples:

- No container or host process activity monitoring
- No network communications monitoring among microservices
- No resource consumption monitoring to ensure availability of critical resources
- Lack of monitoring on orchestration configuration propagation and stale configs
